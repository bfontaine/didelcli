v0.1.1, (upcoming version) -- Python 2.6 support

General changes:

* Python 2.6 and 3.x support fixed
* Persistent Cookies (broken) support removed

Python API:

* Internal exceptions are now of the class `DidelError` instead of `Exception`
* `DidelEntity#fetch` method now properly handle objects with no `path`
* Some classes are imported in `__init__`, making them available with a shorter
  form:
      from didel import Student
  instead of:
      from didel.student import Student
  These classes are: `Course`, `CourseAssignment`, `CourseAssignments`,
  `Session`, and `Student`.
* `Student#login`â€™s `save` optional argument removed
* `Session#save` and `Session#load` removed

Command line:

* `courses:show <code>` added to open a course's page in the browser
* `courses:alias <alias> <code>` added. It allows one to set an alias for each
  course:
    $ didel courses:show M2T2INFOEMB       # course code, hard to remember
    blah blah
    $ didel courses:show emb               # this one doesn't exist
    <error>
    $ didel courses:alias emb M2T2INFOEMB  # alias it to a shorter name
    $ didel courses:show emb               # easier to remember
    blah blah
  Aliases are stored in the configuration file, which makes them easy to edit
  with your text editor.
